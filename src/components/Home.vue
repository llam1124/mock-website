              Our vision is simple: a challenging yet supportive environment that promotes a 
              work-life balance. We envision a fun place to work with motivated people leveraging 
              their skill set on challenging projects. We envisage a company where we can self-actualize. 
              Therefore, we encourage hobbies and retreats, both technical and non-technical, and support 
              the freedom for our team members to choose their own work schedule. We visualize fostering 
              a connection with our associates in which we all collaborate and share our knowledge, ideas 
              and suggestions to enhance ourselves, our company and the defense field.
