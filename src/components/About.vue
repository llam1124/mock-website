            <h2>Woman Owned Small Business</h2>
                  <p>
        Nissint Technologies was created by Nissa and John Ellinwood who, 
        after long careers in the Intelligence Community, decided it was time 
        to take their skills and experience and build a company that realized 
        their vision of an ideal place to work. 
      </p>
      <p>
        That vision was simple, to surround themselves with the best developers 
        in their fields, and to work on the most challenging and rewarding projects around. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Nissint’s leadership team has backgrounds in hardware and software engineering, 
        consulting, business, and program management, which brings together all the traits 
        necessary to build a successful business, along with a strong history of supporting 
        the Intelligence Community. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With career histories working as government civilians,
        and as contractors at both large and small businesses,
        the leadership team was able to create a culture that
        took the best aspects of each place they worked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, the result is an established software development company
        whose name is recognized and respected throughout the community.
